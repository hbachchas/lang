_Notes_  
Its important to see how the connections are made in their model of neocortex. i.e. is it following a hebbian rule or what?  
HTM summary:  
- biologically neuron is binary (it is either spiking or not)
- SDRs are important
- neocortex is hierarchical (doesn't know what it is given, it has some idea about it). passes information to higher layers
- neocortex capsule is repeated through-out the neocortex plain of the brain
